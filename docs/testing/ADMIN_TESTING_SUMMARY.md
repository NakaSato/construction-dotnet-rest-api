## 📊 Admin Endpoint Coverage

### 🔐 Authentication & User Management
| Feature | Status | Endpoints Tested |
|---------|--------|------------------|
| Admin Login | ✅ Working | `/api/v1/auth/login` |
| Token Refresh | ⚠️ Format Issue | `/api/v1/auth/refresh` |
| User Creation | ✅ Working | `/api/v1/auth/register` |
| User Management | ✅ Working | `/api/v1/users` |

### 📋 Core Data Management
| Entity | Read | Create | Update | Delete | Status |
|--------|------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Projects** | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❓ | ❓ | 75% Working |
| **Tasks** | ✅ | ❓ | ❓ | ❓ | 50% Working |
| **Daily Reports** | ✅ | ❓ | ❓ | ❓ | 50% Working |
| **Work Requests** | ✅ | ❓ | ❓ | ❓ | 50% Working |
| **Calendar Events** | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ❓ | ❓ | 25% Working (Rate Limited) |
| **Images** | ❓ | ❌ | ❓ | ❓ | 0% Working |

### 🔍 Advanced Features
| Feature | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Pagination | ✅ Working | All list endpoints support pagination |
| Filtering | ✅ Working | Date ranges, status filters work |
| Search | ✅ Working | Project search functionality |
| Conflict Detection | ⚠️ Rate Limited | Calendar conflict checking |

## 💡 Key Recommendations

### 1. **High Priority Fixes**
```bash
# Fix refresh token format
curl -X POST /api/v1/auth/refresh \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '"raw_token_string"'  # Try this format instead

# Fix project creation - add Address field
{
  "name": "Test Project",
  "description": "Test description", 
  "address": "123 Main St, City, State",  # Add this required field
  "location": "Test Location",
  "budget": 150000.00
}
```

### 2. **Rate Limiting Solutions**
- Increase rate limits for testing environment
- Add delays between requests in test scripts
- Consider role-based rate limiting (higher limits for admins)

### 3. **Missing Endpoint Investigation**
- Verify image upload endpoint implementation
- Check multipart/form-data handling
- Ensure proper error responses

---

## 🎯 Admin Privileges Verified

### ✅ Confirmed Admin Capabilities
1. **User Management**: ✅ Can create and view all users
2. **System Access**: ✅ Full access to all projects, tasks, reports
3. **Health Monitoring**: ✅ Can access detailed system diagnostics
4. **Data Filtering**: ✅ Can filter and search across all entities
5. **Pagination Control**: ✅ Can control page sizes and navigation

### 🔐 Admin-Only Features Working
