# Master Plan & Overall Progress Feature System

## Overview

The Master Plan & Overall Progress Feature is a comprehensive project management system designed specifically for solar installation projects. It allows Project Managers to create detailed project plans, track progress in real-time, and provide stakeholders with accurate project status information.

## Key Components

### 1. Master Plan Creation
Project Managers can create comprehensive master plans that include:

- **Project Phases**: Sequential stages of work (e.g., Site Assessment, Permit Application, Installation, Testing)
- **Milestones**: Key achievements and checkpoints throughout the project
- **Resource Planning**: Personnel, equipment, and material allocation
- **Budget Tracking**: Estimated vs actual costs
- **Timeline Management**: Planned vs actual schedules

### 2. Phase Management
Each phase contains:
- **Task Breakdown**: Individual tasks within each phase
- **Progress Tracking**: Completion percentage (0-100%)
- **Resource Allocation**: Specific resources needed for the phase
- **Dependencies**: Prerequisites that must be completed first
- **Risk Assessment**: Low, Medium, High, Critical risk levels

### 3. Milestone Tracking
Milestones provide key checkpoints:
- **Completion Criteria**: Clear definition of what constitutes completion
- **Verification Process**: Who verifies and approves completion
- **Impact Assessment**: Weight in overall project completion
- **Evidence Documentation**: Proof of milestone achievement

### 4. Progress Calculation Algorithm

The system calculates overall progress using a weighted approach:

```
Overall Progress = Σ(Phase Completion × Phase Weight) + Milestone Bonus
```

Where:
- **Phase Completion**: Current completion percentage of each phase
- **Phase Weight**: Importance of each phase in the overall project (0-100%)
- **Milestone Bonus**: Additional progress from completed milestones (up to 10% bonus)

### 5. Health Status Assessment

Project health is determined by multiple factors:

- **Excellent (Green)**: Ahead of schedule and under budget
- **Good (Green)**: On track with schedule and budget
- **Caution (Yellow)**: Minor issues but manageable
- **At Risk (Orange)**: Significant issues requiring attention
- **Critical (Red)**: Major issues threatening project success

### 6. Performance Metrics

The system tracks several key performance indicators (KPIs):

#### Schedule Performance Index (SPI)
```
SPI = Actual Progress / Planned Progress
```
- SPI = 1.0: On schedule
- SPI < 1.0: Behind schedule
- SPI > 1.0: Ahead of schedule

#### Cost Performance Index (CPI)
```
CPI = Budgeted Cost / Actual Cost
```
- CPI = 1.0: On budget
- CPI < 1.0: Over budget
- CPI > 1.0: Under budget

#### Estimated Completion Date
```
Projected End Date = Current Date + (Remaining Work / Current Progress Rate)
```
