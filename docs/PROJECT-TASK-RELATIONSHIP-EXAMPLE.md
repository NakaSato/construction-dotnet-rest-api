## 📊 Relationship Characteristics

### **1. Hierarchical Structure**
```
🏭 PWA-107: สำนักงานประปาเขต 9
├── 📋 Site Survey and Measurement
├── 📋 Install Solar Panel Mounting System
├── 📋 [Future] Install 220 Solar Panels
├── 📋 [Future] Electrical Connections & Inverters
└── 📋 [Future] System Testing & Commissioning
```

### **2. Database Foreign Key Relationship**
- Each task has `projectId: "608685d3-e364-4b85-98c6-39d4a09af78b"`
- Tasks cannot exist without a parent project
- Project deletion would cascade to delete all associated tasks

### **3. API Response Integration**
Every task response includes project context:
```json
{
  "taskId": "921f0a5b-f7e8-4890-9375-3dee1c9748a0",
  "projectId": "608685d3-e364-4b85-98c6-39d4a09af78b",
  "projectName": "PWA-107: สำนักงานประปาเขต 9",
  "title": "Site Survey and Measurement",
  "description": "Conduct comprehensive site survey...",
  "status": "NotStarted",
  "dueDate": "2025-07-15T09:00:00Z"
}
```

### **4. Access Control Inheritance**
- Project managers can manage all project tasks
- Tasks inherit project-level permissions
- Technicians can be assigned to specific tasks within projects

## 🛠️ API Operations Demonstrating Relationship

### **Create Task for Project**
```bash
# Requires project ID when creating task
POST /api/v1/tasks?projectId=608685d3-e364-4b85-98c6-39d4a09af78b
```

### **Filter Tasks by Project**
```bash
# Get only tasks for this specific project
GET /api/v1/tasks?projectId=608685d3-e364-4b85-98c6-39d4a09af78b
```

### **Task Response Always Includes Project Info**
- `projectId` - Links task to parent project
- `projectName` - Human-readable project identification
- Tasks inherit project context automatically

## 🎯 Business Logic Benefits

### **1. Work Breakdown Structure**
- Large solar projects broken into manageable tasks
- Each task represents specific deliverable work
- Sequential dependencies can be managed

### **2. Resource Planning**
- Tasks can be assigned to specific technicians
- Project managers oversee all project tasks
- Work scheduling based on task dependencies

### **3. Progress Tracking**
- Project completion calculated from task completion
- Individual task progress contributes to project status
- Detailed reporting at both project and task levels

### **4. Quality Control**
- Each task can have specific completion criteria
- Tasks can be reviewed and approved independently
- Project-level quality gates based on task completion

## 📈 Workflow Example

### **Typical Solar Installation Project Workflow:**

1. **Project Creation:** "PWA-107: สำนักงานประปาเขต 9"
2. **Task Breakdown:**
   - Site Survey and Measurement
   - Permit Application and Approval
   - Equipment Procurement
   - Install Mounting System
   - Install Solar Panels
   - Electrical Connections
   - Inverter Installation
   - System Testing
   - Grid Connection
   - Final Commissioning

3. **Task Assignment:** Each task assigned to appropriate specialists
4. **Progress Tracking:** Project status updated based on task completion
5. **Project Completion:** All tasks completed = Project completed

## 🔧 Script Usage for Relationship Management

### **List All Projects with Their Tasks**
```bash
# First get projects
./scripts/quick-tasks.sh list

# Then get tasks for specific project
./scripts/quick-tasks.sh list-project PROJECT_ID
```

### **Create Hierarchical Task Structure**
```bash
PROJECT_ID="608685d3-e364-4b85-98c6-39d4a09af78b"

# Create sequential tasks
./scripts/quick-tasks.sh create $PROJECT_ID  # Site Survey
./scripts/quick-tasks.sh create $PROJECT_ID  # Mounting System
./scripts/quick-tasks.sh create $PROJECT_ID  # Panel Installation
./scripts/quick-tasks.sh create $PROJECT_ID  # Electrical Work
./scripts/quick-tasks.sh create $PROJECT_ID  # Testing
```

### **Track Project Progress Through Tasks**
```bash
# View overall task status
./scripts/quick-tasks.sh list-project $PROJECT_ID

# Update individual task progress
./scripts/quick-tasks.sh update-status TASK_ID

# Monitor project completion through task completion
```

## 📋 Summary

The **Project-Task relationship** in the Solar Projects API provides:

✅ **Clear Hierarchy:** Projects contain multiple related tasks  
✅ **Mandatory Association:** Every task belongs to exactly one project  
✅ **Context Inheritance:** Tasks inherit project information and permissions  
✅ **Flexible Filtering:** Tasks can be viewed by project or across all projects  
✅ **Progress Tracking:** Project completion measured through task completion  
✅ **Resource Management:** Tasks enable granular work assignment and tracking  

This relationship structure enables comprehensive management of complex solar installation projects while maintaining clear organization and accountability at both strategic (project) and operational (task) levels.
