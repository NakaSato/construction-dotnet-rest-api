## Authentication

All notification endpoints require JWT authentication. Include the token in the Authorization header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

For real-time connections via SignalR, provide the token either:
1. In the query string: `?access_token=<token>` (Not recommended for production)
2. Using the accessTokenFactory option in the client configuration (preferred method)

### Permission Levels
- **User**: Can view and manage own notifications
- **Manager**: Can view team notifications and create system announcements
- **Admin**: Full notification management and system-wide announcements

### Token Renewal and Expiration
SignalR connections need valid tokens throughout the connection lifetime. Implement token renewal to maintain long-lived connections.

*Code example removed - see implementation guide*

Mobile applications should implement similar token refresh mechanisms using platform-specific methods.

   - Consider time-to-live (TTL) policies for old notifications

2. **Caching Strategy**
   - Cache frequently accessed notifications
   - Use Redis for notification counters and status
   - Implement notification deduplication

3. **Load Balancing**
   - Use sticky sessions for SignalR connections
   - Implement horizontal scaling with Redis backplane
   - Distribute push notification workloads across dedicated workers

### High Volume Scenarios

For systems with high notification volumes (>100k notifications/day):

1. **Queue Processing**
   - Implement notification prioritization
   - Use separate queues for different notification types
   - Set up dead letter queues for failed notifications
   - Implement retry policies with exponential backoff

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Apply per-user rate limits to prevent notification flooding
   - Implement throttling for high-frequency notification sources
   - Consolidate similar notifications into digest formats

3. **Monitoring**
   - Track notification delivery metrics
   - Monitor client reconnection patterns
   - Set up alerts for notification delivery failures

   - Mark all as read button
   - Loading indicator for initial fetch
   - Error handling with retry option
   - Empty state messaging
   - Pull-to-refresh functionality

2. **State Management:**
   - Consume notification provider state
   - Display notifications in a scrollable list
   - Handle loading and error states
   - Support pagination for large notification sets

3. **User Interactions:**
   - Tap to view notification details
   - Mark individual notifications as read
   - Swipe actions for quick operations
   - Filter options for notification types

### Notification Badge Example

Implement notification badges in your app's navigation:

1. **Badge Components:**
   - Unread count indicator
   - Visual styling for attention
   - State-based visibility control
   - Animation for new notifications

2. **Integration Points:**
   - Bottom navigation bar items
   - Tab bar icons
   - App icon badge (platform-specific)
   - Header notification icons

3. **State Management:**
   - Real-time unread count updates
   - Badge visibility based on count
   - Badge clearing on notification view

        },
      ),
      label: 'Notifications',
    ),
    BottomNavigationBarItem(
      icon: Icon(Icons.person),
      label: 'Profile',
    ),
  ],
)
```

### Best Practices for Flutter Integration

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Use connection state management to handle background/foreground transitions
   - Implement efficient caching for offline access to notifications
   - Use pagination with lazy loading for notification lists
   - Consider debouncing real-time events to prevent UI jank

2. **Battery Efficiency**
   - Disconnect SignalR when app is in background for extended periods
   - Use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for background notifications
   - Reconnect SignalR when app returns to foreground
   - Implement adaptive polling intervals based on app state

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement robust reconnection logic for SignalR
   - Cache notifications locally to handle offline scenarios
   - Provide clear feedback to users during connectivity issues
   - Implement graceful degradation to REST API when real-time fails

4. **Security Considerations**
   - Securely store authentication tokens
   - Implement proper token refresh logic
   - Sanitize notification content before display
   - Validate deep links in notification payloads

5. **Testing**
   - Test notification handling in various connectivity scenarios
   - Verify background/foreground notification behavior
   - Test reconnection flows after network interruptions
   - Validate notification interactions across different device states
