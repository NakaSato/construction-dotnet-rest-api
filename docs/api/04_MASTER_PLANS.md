Master plans serve as the central planning schedule that coordinates all schedules within a solar project. Each master plan belongs to a project and acts as the comprehensive scheduling framework.

## Project-Master Plan Relationship

- **Project** is the primary business entity containing high-level project information
- **Master Plan** belongs to a Project (1:1 relationship) and serves as the central planning schedule
- A Project can have only one active Master Plan at a time
- Master Plans coordinate and contain all project schedules:
  - Phase Schedules: Detailed timelines for each project phase
  - Task Schedules: Individual work item timelines and dependencies
  - Milestone Schedules: Key deliverable and checkpoint dates
  - Resource Schedules: Personnel, equipment, and material allocation
  - Approval Schedules: Workflow and approval process timelines

## Administrator & Project Manager Capabilities

- Create new master plans for projects
- Update plan details (name, description, dates, budget)
- Manage plan status and versioning
- Coordinate all project schedules within the master plan
- Track progress across all integrated schedules
- Resolve schedule conflicts and optimize resource allocation
- Generate comprehensive scheduling reports
- Approve and submit plans for execution

## User & Viewer Access

- Read-only access to approved master plans and all contained schedules
- Cannot modify plan information
- Can view project progress and milestone tracking
- Access to schedule-based reports

## Master Plan as Central Scheduling Framework

The Master Plan serves as the central planning schedule for all schedules within a project.

### Integrated Schedule Management
- **Phase Schedules**: Breaks down the project into manageable time-based phases
- **Task Schedules**: Individual work items with start/end dates and dependencies
- **Milestone Schedules**: Key deliverables and checkpoint dates across all phases
- **Resource Schedules**: Personnel, equipment, and material allocation timelines
- **Approval Schedules**: Workflow deadlines and approval process timelines

### ‚ö° Schedule Coordination Features
- **Dependency Management**: Links between different schedule components
- **Conflict Resolution**: Identifies and resolves scheduling conflicts across all schedules
- **Resource Optimization**: Prevents double-booking and optimizes resource utilization
- **Timeline Synchronization**: Ensures all sub-schedules align with master timeline
- **Progress Tracking**: Unified progress monitoring across all schedule components

### üìä Schedule Analytics
- **Critical Path Analysis**: Identifies bottlenecks across all integrated schedules
- **Resource Utilization**: Tracks allocation efficiency across all schedule types
- **Schedule Performance**: Monitors adherence to planned vs. actual timelines
- **Variance Analysis**: Identifies deviations from planned schedules

## üìä Master Plan Status Workflow & Business Logic

Master plans follow a sophisticated status workflow with advanced business logic for coordinating all project schedules, managing dependencies across schedule types, and maintaining hierarchical project structure as the central planning authority.

### Status Workflow
| Status | Description | Available Actions | Who Can Change |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Draft** | Initial creation, all schedules editable | Edit schedules, Submit for Approval, Delete | Creator, Admin |
| **Pending** | Submitted for approval with all schedules | Approve, Reject, Request Changes | Admin, Senior PM |
| **Approved** | Ready for execution, schedules locked | Start Execution, Archive | Admin, PM |
| **InProgress** | Currently being executed, live schedule tracking | Update Progress, Complete | Admin, PM |
| **Completed** | Successfully finished, all schedules complete | Archive, Generate Report | Admin, PM |
| **Cancelled** | Cancelled before completion, schedules voided | Archive, Restart | Admin |

### Advanced Schedule Coordination & Integration

The system implements sophisticated, multi-level schedule coordination using the master plan as the central scheduling authority:

#### üî¢ Schedule Integration Formulas

**Phase Schedule Completion (Weighted Average)**:
```
PhaseScheduleCompletion = Œ£(TaskScheduleCompletion[i] √ó TaskDuration[i]) / Œ£(TaskDuration[i])
```

**Overall Master Schedule Completion**:
```
MasterScheduleCompletion = Œ£(PhaseScheduleCompletion[p] √ó PhaseWeight[p])
```

**Schedule Performance Index (SPI)**:
```
SPI = Earned Schedule Value / Planned Schedule Value
```

For solar projects, the master plan typically coordinates these schedule weights:
- Planning & Permitting Schedule: 15% weight
- Procurement & Logistics Schedule: 10% weight  
- Construction & Installation Schedule: 65% weight
- Testing & Handover Schedule: 10% weight

#### üîó Schedule Dependencies & Critical Path Analysis

The master plan supports comprehensive dependency management across all schedule types:

| Dependency Type | Code | Description | Example Use Case |
|------|------|-------------|------------------|
| **Finish-to-Start** | FS | Schedule B starts after Schedule A finishes | Phase schedule ‚Üí Next phase schedule |
| **Start-to-Start** | SS | Schedule B starts when Schedule A starts | Parallel task schedules |
| **Finish-to-Finish** | FF | Schedule B finishes when Schedule A finishes | Milestone schedules alignment |
| **Start-to-Finish** | SF | Schedule B finishes when Schedule A starts | Resource handoff schedules |

#### üèóÔ∏è Resource Schedule Dependencies

Beyond logical schedule dependencies, the master plan models **Resource Schedule Dependencies** where multiple schedules compete for limited resources (crews, equipment). This prevents scheduling conflicts and identifies potential bottlenecks across all project schedules.

#### üìà Hierarchical Schedule Structure

The master plan uses **recursive scheduling algorithms** to handle unlimited nesting levels with **Project as the root scheduling entity**:
- **Project** (Root Schedule) ‚Üí **Master Plan** (Central Schedule) ‚Üí **Phase Schedules** ‚Üí **Task Schedules** ‚Üí **Sub-task Schedules**
- Each schedule level contributes to the parent schedule completion
- Project-level schedule aggregates Master Plan schedule completion
- Master Plan inherits Project schedule constraints and stakeholder requirements
- Supports future schedule expansion without architectural changes

### Project-Master Plan Schedule Model

## üîß Master Plan Error Codes

| Error Code | Description | Resolution |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| **MP001** | Master plan not found | Verify the plan ID exists |
| **MP002** | Project already has a master plan | Update existing plan or create new version |
| **MP003** | Invalid project ID | Ensure project exists and is accessible |
| **MP004** | Insufficient permissions | Check user role requirements |
| **MP005** | Cannot delete plan with active tasks | Complete or remove associated tasks first |
| **MP006** | Invalid status transition | Follow the defined workflow sequence |
| **MP007** | Project not found | Verify the parent project exists before creating master plan |
| **MP008** | Project-Master Plan relationship violation | Cannot modify project reference after master plan creation |

## üîó Project Context Integration

Master Plans are deeply integrated with their parent Project and inherit key contextual information:

### Inherited Project Attributes
- **Project Budget**: Master Plan budget cannot exceed Project total budget
- **Project Timeline**: Master Plan dates must fall within Project start/end dates  
- **Project Stakeholders**: Notification and approval workflows use Project stakeholder lists
- **Project Location**: Geographic and site-specific constraints from Project
- **Project Type**: Solar installation specifications and compliance requirements

### Project-Level Constraints
- Each Project can have only **one active Master Plan** at any time
- Archived Master Plans remain linked to Project for historical tracking
- Master Plan status changes may trigger Project status updates
- Project completion requires Master Plan completion

### Cross-Reference Endpoints

**Get Project Information from Master Plan**:
```http
GET /api/v1/master-plans/{masterPlanId}/project
```

**Get All Master Plans for Project (including archived)**:
```http
GET /api/v1/projects/{projectId}/master-plans?includeArchived=true
```

## üéØ Summary: Master Plan as Central Scheduling Authority

The Master Plan serves as the **single source of truth for all project scheduling**, functioning as:

### üìÖ Unified Schedule Management
- **Central Coordination Point**: All project schedules flow through and are managed by the master plan
- **Schedule Integration**: Combines phase schedules, task schedules, milestone schedules, resource schedules, and approval schedules into one coherent framework
- **Conflict Resolution**: Identifies and resolves scheduling conflicts across all schedule types before they impact project delivery

### ‚ö° Real-Time Schedule Synchronization
- **Live Updates**: Changes to any sub-schedule automatically update the master plan and all related schedules
- **Dependency Cascade**: Schedule changes trigger automatic updates to dependent schedules throughout the project
- **Resource Optimization**: Prevents double-booking and optimizes resource allocation across all project schedules

### üìä Comprehensive Schedule Analytics
- **Critical Path Tracking**: Identifies the longest sequence of dependent schedules that determines project completion
- **Schedule Performance Monitoring**: Tracks planned vs. actual progress across all integrated schedules
- **Predictive Scheduling**: Uses historical data and current progress to forecast schedule completion and identify potential delays

### üîó Stakeholder Schedule Communication
- **Unified Reporting**: Provides stakeholders with a single, coherent view of all project schedules
- **Role-Based Schedule Views**: Delivers schedule information tailored to different stakeholder needs (executives, project managers, technicians)
- **Automated Schedule Notifications**: Alerts stakeholders to schedule changes, conflicts, or milestones across all schedule types

The master plan ensures that all project activities are properly scheduled, coordinated, and tracked within a single, integrated scheduling framework that serves as the definitive planning schedule for the entire project.
