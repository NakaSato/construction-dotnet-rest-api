echo "Summary:"
echo "• The login 'username' field is flexible and accepts both username and email"
echo "• This provides a better user experience - users can login with either"
echo "• The backend automatically matches against both User.Username and User.Email"
echo "• Currently working: admin@example.com (fallback credentials)"
echo "• Future: admin or admin@example.com (when database user is seeded)"
echo ""
echo "💡 Frontend Integration Tip:"
echo "Your login form can have a single 'Username or Email' field instead of separate fields!"
