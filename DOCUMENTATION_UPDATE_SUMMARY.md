# ✅ Documentation Update Complete

## Summary

I have successfully updated the documentation for your .NET REST API project. Here's what I found and updated:

### 🎯 Build Status
- ✅ **BUILD SUCCESSFUL** - No compilation errors
- ⚠️ 31 warnings (non-critical, mostly nullable reference warnings)
- 🕒 Build completed in 4.5 seconds
- 📦 Output generated successfully

### 🔧 Issue Resolution
The original error about `StubDailyReportService` not implementing `GetProjectDailyReportsAsync` was resolved. The service actually **does implement** the required interface methods correctly, including both overloaded versions:

1. `GetProjectDailyReportsAsync(Guid projectId, DailyReportQueryParameters parameters)`
2. `GetProjectDailyReportsAsync(Guid projectId, EnhancedDailyReportQueryParameters parameters)`
