CI/CD Pipeline Considerations
The CI/CD pipelines will be designed to automate as much of the build, test, and deployment process as possible.

Automated Builds: Builds will be automatically triggered on every code commit to the main development branches.
Automated Testing: Unit tests and integration tests will be executed automatically as part of the pipeline. A build will fail if tests do not pass.
Automated Deployments: Deployments to staging and production environments will be automated, with manual approval gates for production releases.
Database Migrations: EF Core database migration scripts will be integrated into the backend deployment process to ensure the database schema is updated consistently with the application version.
