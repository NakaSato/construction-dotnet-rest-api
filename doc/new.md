Architecting a.NET API for Solar Construction Daily Reporting and Work Requests
I. Executive Summary
This report outlines the architectural design and implementation strategy for a robust, scalable, and secure.NET-based Application Programming Interface (API) tailored for solar construction daily reporting and work requests. The proposed solution leverages a modular monolith architecture, providing a balance between development simplicity and the flexibility to evolve. Key technologies include ASP.NET Core for the API framework, Entity Framework Core for data persistence (primarily with PostgreSQL), and OpenAPI (Swagger) for comprehensive API documentation.

The design emphasizes secure user authentication and authorization using ASP.NET Core Identity with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and policy-based access control. It addresses critical functionalities such as efficient file handling for progress photos and documents (utilizing Azure Blob Storage or an S3-compatible equivalent), real-time notifications via SignalR, background job processing with Hangfire for tasks like notifications and report generation, and strategies for offline data synchronization to support field workers in low-connectivity environments.

Furthermore, the report details measures for ensuring system quality and reliability, including performance optimization through distributed caching with Redis, and comprehensive system observability via structured logging with Serilog, monitoring with Azure Application Insights, and tracing with OpenTelemetry, potentially orchestrated using.NET Aspire. A phased implementation roadmap is suggested, starting with core reporting functionalities and progressively adding advanced features. The success of this API hinges on strong adherence to modular design principles, comprehensive documentation, iterative development based on user feedback, and a security-by-design approach.

II. API Design and Architecture
The foundation of an effective system lies in a well-defined API and a sound architectural approach. This section details the core API endpoint design, adherence to RESTful principles, and the data models underpinning the solar construction reporting and work request functionalities.

A. Core API Endpoints
The API will expose a set of RESTful endpoints organized around key resources such as projects, daily-reports, and work-requests. Versioning will be implemented via URI path (e.g., /v1/...) to manage an evolving API surface and ensure backward compatibility for clients.   

Endpoints will facilitate the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion (CRUD) of daily reports and work requests, along with their constituent elements like work progress items, issues, personnel logs, and material usage. Specific actions, such as submitting a draft report or assigning a task, will also be exposed as dedicated endpoints.

The following table summarizes the primary API interactions, illustrating the resource-oriented approach:

Table II.A.1: Core API Endpoint Specification (Summary)

Resource Group	HTTP Method	URI Pattern	Brief Description	Key Request Body Fields (Example)	Key Response Body Fields (Example)
Daily Reports	POST	/v1/projects/{projectId}/daily-reports	Create a new daily report	reportDate, weatherConditions, workProgressItems, issues	id, reportDate, status, submittedAt, _links
Daily Reports	GET	/v1/projects/{projectId}/daily-reports	List daily reports for a project	(Query params: dateFrom, status, sortBy)	data:, pagination
Daily Reports	GET	/v1/projects/{projectId}/daily-reports/{reportId}	Get a specific daily report	N/A	data: {id, reportDate, weather, workProgress, issues,...}
Daily Reports	PUT	/v1/projects/{projectId}/daily-reports/{reportId}	Update a daily report (full)	reportDate, weatherConditions, workProgressItems, issues	data: {id, reportDate, status,...}
Daily Reports	PATCH	/v1/projects/{projectId}/daily-reports/{reportId}	Partially update a daily report	(e.g., {"generalNotes": "New note"})	data: {id, reportDate, status,...}
Daily Reports	POST	/v1/projects/{projectId}/daily-reports/{reportId}/submit	Submit a draft daily report	(Optional: submissionComment)	data: {id, status: "Submitted",...}
Work Progress	POST	/v1/daily-reports/{reportId}/work-progress	Add a work progress item to a report	taskDescription, status, percentComplete	data: {id, taskDescription, status,...}
Work Requests	POST	/v1/projects/{projectId}/work-requests	Create a new daily work request	requestDate, tasks: [{description, location,...}]	data: {id, requestDate, status,...}
Work Requests	GET	/v1/projects/{projectId}/work-requests/{requestId}	Get a specific work request	N/A	data: {id, requestDate, tasks,...}
Work Request Tasks	PUT	/v1/work-requests/{requestId}/tasks/{taskId}	Update a work request task (e.g., status, assignment)	status, assignedToUserId, actualHours	data: {id, description, status,...}

Export to Sheets
This structure provides a clear and predictable way for clients to interact with the API, aligning with common RESTful practices. The inclusion of _links in responses promotes HATEOAS (Hypertext as the Engine of Application State), allowing clients to discover related actions and resources dynamically.   

B. API Design Principles and Best Practices
The API design will adhere to established industry best practices to ensure it is user-friendly, consistent, secure, and maintainable.   

Use of HTTP Methods: Standard HTTP methods will be used correctly: GET for retrieval, POST for creation, PUT for full updates, PATCH for partial updates, and DELETE for removal. Idempotency will be ensured for PUT and DELETE operations.   
Resource Naming Conventions: URLs will use plural nouns for collections (e.g., /daily-reports) and specific identifiers for individual resources (e.g., /daily-reports/{reportId}). Verbs will be avoided in URIs.   
Statelessness: Each API request from the client will contain all necessary information for the server to process it, without relying on server-side session state. This is crucial for scalability and reliability.   
HTTP Status Codes: Appropriate HTTP status codes will be returned to indicate the outcome of requests (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created, 204 No Content, 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error).   
Standardized Response Format: API responses will consistently use JSON. A standardized wrapper for responses will be adopted, including fields for status (e.g., "success", "error"), data payload, and error messages/codes if applicable. This aids client-side parsing and error handling. For example, a successful response:
JSON

{
    "status": "success",
    "data": { /* resource data */ },
    "message": null
}
And an error response:
JSON

{
    "status": "error",
    "data": null,
    "message": "Validation failed.",
    "errors":
}
  
Pagination, Filtering, and Sorting: For collection endpoints (e.g., GET /daily-reports), query parameters will be used to support pagination (e.g., ?page=1&pageSize=20), filtering (e.g., ?status=Submitted&dateFrom=2023-01-01), and sorting (e.g., ?sortBy=reportDate&sortOrder=desc).   
API Versioning: As mentioned, URI path versioning (e.g., /api/v1/...) will be used. This is a clear and common approach. Major versions indicate breaking changes.   
Security: Authentication and authorization are paramount and are detailed in Section III.A. All communication will be over HTTPS.   
Documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger): The API will be documented using the OpenAPI specification. Tools like Swashbuckle (for.NET Framework/Core) or the newer Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi (for.NET 9+) will be used to generate the openapi.json file and serve a Swagger UI for interactive documentation and testing. This documentation is critical for developer experience and successful API adoption. Treating the OpenAPI specification as a primary artifact throughout the development lifecycle is essential, ensuring that any changes to the API are promptly reflected in the specification. This practice fosters better collaboration between backend API developers and those developing frontend or client applications.   
C. Data Modeling for Key Entities
