Architecture
A layered architecture, such as Clean Architecture or a similar pattern (e.g., Presentation, Domain, Data layers), is recommended for the Flutter application. This approach promotes a clear separation of concerns, enhances testability by isolating business logic from UI and data access, and improves overall maintainability, making the codebase more manageable as it scales.
