# CI/CD Workflow Status

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Workflow Trigger Conflicts ✅
**Problem**: Multiple workflows (`ci.yml`, `main-pipeline.yml`, `deploy.yml`) were triggered by the same events (push to main), causing duplicate runs and resource waste.

**Solution**: 
- `ci.yml`: Now triggers on feature branches and PRs only
- `main-pipeline.yml`: Triggers on main branch pushes and manual dispatch
- `deploy.yml`: Manual deployment only
- `ci-simple.yml`: Scheduled runs and manual dispatch only

### 2. Environment Management ✅
**Problem**: Inconsistent environment handling and deployment logic.

**Solution**:
- Added workflow_dispatch inputs for environment selection
- Proper environment conditions for deployment jobs
- Separate staging and production deployment logic

### 3. Container Registry Logic ✅
**Problem**: Docker image pushes happening on all triggers, including PRs.

**Solution**:
- Container registry pushes only on main branch pushes
- Local testing for all other triggers
- Proper image tagging strategy

### 4. Security and Validation ✅
**Problem**: Missing secret validation and security checks.

**Solution**:
- Added `secrets-check.yml` workflow for secret validation
- Enhanced CodeQL configuration in security scan
- Better error handling and reporting

## Current Workflow Structure

### Core CI/CD Workflows

1. **ci.yml** - Development CI
   - Triggers: Feature branches, PRs to main/develop
   - Purpose: Fast feedback for development
   - Actions: Build, test, basic validation

2. **main-pipeline.yml** - Production CD
   - Triggers: Main branch pushes, manual dispatch
   - Purpose: Complete CI/CD pipeline for production
   - Actions: Build, test, Docker build/push, deploy to Azure

3. **deploy.yml** - Manual Deployment
   - Triggers: Manual dispatch only
   - Purpose: Emergency deployments or specific environment deployments
   - Actions: Build and deploy to specified environment

### Supporting Workflows

4. **ci-simple.yml** - Nightly Builds
   - Triggers: Schedule (nightly), manual dispatch
   - Purpose: Regular health checks and regression testing

5. **security-scan.yml** - Security Scanning
   - Triggers: Push to main/develop, PRs, weekly schedule
   - Purpose: Vulnerability scanning and security analysis

6. **secrets-check.yml** - Secret Validation
   - Triggers: Manual dispatch, weekly schedule
   - Purpose: Validate required secrets are configured

7. **codeql.yml** - Code Quality Analysis
   - Triggers: Push to main, weekly schedule
   - Purpose: Static code analysis and security scanning

8. **database-migration.yml** - Database Operations
   - Triggers: Manual dispatch only
   - Purpose: Database migrations in different environments

9. **performance-test.yml** - Performance Testing
   - Triggers: Manual dispatch only
   - Purpose: Load testing and performance validation

10. **infrastructure.yml** - Infrastructure Deployment
    - Triggers: Manual dispatch only
    - Purpose: Azure infrastructure deployment

## Required Secrets

### Essential for Deployment
- `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`: Azure service principal credentials (JSON format)
- `AZURE_DB_CONNECTION_STRING`: Database connection string

### Optional for Enhanced Functionality
- `JWT_SECRET`: JWT signing key
- `JWT_ISSUER`: JWT issuer name

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Checks
1. **Weekly**: Run secrets validation workflow
2. **Weekly**: Review security scan results
3. **Monthly**: Update action versions
4. **Quarterly**: Review and optimize workflow performance

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Build success rate
- Deployment frequency
- Mean time to recovery (MTTR)
- Test coverage trends
- Security vulnerability counts

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**
   - Check .NET version compatibility
   - Verify NuGet package restoration
   - Review dependency conflicts

2. **Deployment Failures**
   - Validate Azure credentials
   - Check connection strings
   - Verify resource availability

3. **Test Failures**
   - Database connection issues
   - Environment variable mismatches
   - Service registration problems

4. **Security Scan Issues**
   - Update vulnerable packages
   - Review CodeQL findings
   - Address container security issues

### Recovery Procedures

1. **Failed Deployment**
   - Use manual deploy workflow
   - Check rollback procedures
   - Verify health endpoints

2. **Database Issues**
   - Use database migration workflow
   - Check backup procedures
   - Validate connection strings

3. **Security Issues**
   - Run immediate security scan
   - Update vulnerable dependencies
   - Review access logs
